Request summary: Continue with the first server and client implementation.
Assistance: Generated the initial C server and client, compilation
commands, Makefile and executable ignore rules.
Validation: Compiled both programs on CentOS, ran a loopback

Validation: Compiled on CentOS and tested two simultaneous users,
user listing, join/leave notifications and graceful QUIT.
Shared execution screenshots for review.

## Entry 4 - Broadcast and private messaging
Requested the next implementation step after registration and listing.
AI supplied BCAST and PMSG handlers and manual two-client test instructions.
Applied the changes, rebuilt the server, and tested broadcast delivery,
private-message delivery and an unknown recipient.
Shared terminal screenshots for review; the observed results matched
the expected responses. Three-client privacy testing remains pending.

## Entry 5 - Room messaging
Uploaded the current server source and requested room support.
AI added JOIN, LEAVE, ROOMS, RMSG and membership cleanup, and reported
compilation and automated checks in its own environment.
Installed the updated source in CentOS and manually tested room joining,
listing, message delivery, leaving and rejection after leaving.
Shared screenshots and repeated the initial commands individually
after input-format problems. The repeated tests matched expected results.
