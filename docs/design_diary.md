# Design Diary - IT23584754

## 2026-10-06 - Initial TCP connection

Set up the project on CentOS Stream 10 using GCC, GNU Make and Git.
Recorded the personalised TCP port 10754 and response tag NID:5847
in the README.

Implemented an initial TCP server using socket, bind, listen and
accept. Implemented a client using socket and connect. The server
currently accepts each connection and closes it immediately.

Validation:
- Both programs compiled without displayed warnings or errors.
- The client connected to 127.0.0.1:10754.
- The server displayed the accepted connection.
- Both programs rebuilt successfully using Makefile_4754.

Added the compiled executable names to .gitignore and committed
the source files and Makefile.

Next:
Keep connections open, implement newline-delimited command parsing,
and support multiple clients with REGISTER, LIST and QUIT.

## Registration and presence milestone
Implemented one thread per client and mutex-protected shared user data.
Added newline-delimited command reading, complete-send handling,
REGISTER, LIST, QUIT and join/leave notifications.
Updated the client to monitor keyboard and socket input using select.

Observed tests:
- Alice and Bob remained registered simultaneously.
- LIST returned alice,bob.
- Alice received Bob's JOINED and LEFT notifications.
- Bob received OK BYE NID:5847 before disconnection.
- Observed OK responses included the correct NID:5847 suffix.

Duplicate-name rejection and five simultaneous clients still need testing.

## Broadcast and private messaging milestone
Added BCAST to send a message to other registered clients.
Added PMSG to find a registered recipient and deliver a private message.

Observed tests:
- Alice's broadcast reached Bob and Alice received OK SENT.
- Bob's private message reached Alice and Bob received OK SENT.
- PMSG to nobody returned ERR 002 USER_NOT_FOUND.
- These OK and ERR replies included NID:5847.
- The server compiled without displayed warnings or errors.
- Earlier duplicate registration testing returned ERR 001 USERNAME_TAKEN;
  retrying with a different username succeeded.

Still to verify: private-message isolation with a third client and
at least five simultaneous clients.
